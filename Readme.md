# apply

Faster apply than the native Function.prototype.apply

## Installation

    $ npm install micro-js/apply

## Usage

apply accepts three parameters:

  * `fn` - The function to invoke
  * `args` - The argument list as an array
  * `ctx` - The context upon which to invoke `fn` (optional)

## Performance

Here's the [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/apply-vs-switch/7).  In Chrome, it's roughly 2.5x faster than the native apply.
